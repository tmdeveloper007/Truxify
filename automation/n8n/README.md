# Automation & Workflow Orchestration (n8n)

This directory contains production-ready **n8n workflow graphs** for operational automation, AI model lifecycle management, dispute resolution, and driver verification in the Truxify logistics platform.

## 📋 Available Workflows

| Workflow File | Name | Trigger | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [`dispute-resolution.json`](./dispute-resolution.json) | **Dispute Resolution and Escalation Workflow** | Webhook (`POST /webhook/dispute-trigger`) | Automated 24-hour dispute arbitration: freezes escrow on booking dispute, gathers driver GPS trail and OTP logs, packages a dispute PDF, notifies both parties, and escalates unresolved disputes to admin arbitration with email alerts. |
| [`ml_retraining.json`](./ml_retraining.json) | **Weekly ML Model Retraining Pipeline** | Cron (`Monday 02:00 AM`) | Queries PostgreSQL for completed bookings in the last 7 days. If $\ge 100$ new bookings exist, triggers `POST /train/demand` to retrain demand models and emails performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²). |
| [`document-integrity-workflow.json`](./document-integrity-workflow.json) | **Document Integrity Check Workflow** | Schedule (`Every 24 Hours`) | Periodically queries driver active statuses and KYC document expiration/verification statuses. Sends automated alerts if tampering or expiry is detected. |
| [`ml-rollback-workflow.json`](./ml-rollback-workflow.json) | **ML Model Auto-Rollback Pipeline** | Schedule (`Every 1 Hour`) | Checks active A/B tests on the ML Engine (`http://ml-engine:8000/ab-testing/status`). If performance degradation exceeding threshold is detected, executes auto-rollback and alerts the ML team. |

## 🛠️ Environment Configuration

When importing workflows into your n8n instance, ensure the following environment variables are configured in n8n or `docker-compose.yml`:

| Environment Variable | Description | Default / Dev Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `INTERNAL_RELAYER_KEY` | HMAC secret for relayer API calls to backend Express service | `local_relayer_secret` |
| `ML_API_KEY` | API Key for authenticating against the FastAPI ML Engine | `local_ml_secret` |
| `ML_ENGINE_URL` | Base URL of the ML service container | `http://ml-engine:8000` |
| `BACKEND_API_URL` | Base URL of the backend Express API, reachable from the n8n container on the internal Docker network | `http://api:5000` |
| `ADMIN_ALERT_EMAIL` | Operator mailbox for the `dispute-resolution.json` alert nodes: escrow **freeze failed**, escrow **release failed**, and the 24h **arbitration escalation**. Must be a monitored address — these fire when disputed funds are stuck on-chain and need manual intervention. **Required in production**: `docker-compose.prod.yml` refuses to start n8n if it is unset | `admin@localhost` |
| `ALCHEMY_WS_URL` | Full Polygon mempool WebSocket URL including the Alchemy API key (e.g. `wss://polygon-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/<API_KEY>`), consumed by the sentinel workflow | Not set |
| `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Master encryption key for n8n credentials | Configured in `docker-compose.prod.yml` |

## 🚀 Running n8n Locally

n8n is included as a service in both development ([`docker-compose.yml`](../../docker-compose.yml)) and production ([`docker-compose.prod.yml`](../../docker-compose.prod.yml)).

To start n8n locally:

```bash
docker compose up n8n -d
```

Access the n8n Web Console at:
```text
http://localhost:5678
```

### Importing Workflows into n8n:
1. Open n8n UI (`http://localhost:5678`).
2. Click **Workflows** → **Import from File**.
3. Select any `.json` file from `automation/n8n/`.
4. Configure required credentials (PostgreSQL, Email/SMTP, HTTP Header Auth) and click **Activate**.

## 🔐 Escrow Webhook Authentication

`dispute-resolution.json` fronts on-chain escrow operations, so both of its webhooks
(`POST /webhook/dispute-trigger` and `POST /webhook/admin-resolution`) use **Header Auth**
and will reject any request that does not carry the shared secret. Before activating it,
create an **HTTP Header Auth** credential in n8n named exactly:

```text
Truxify Internal API Key
```

Set its header to `x-api-key` and its value to one of the keys listed in the backend's
`VALID_API_KEYS` environment variable. The same credential authenticates this workflow's
outbound calls to the backend, which gates internal endpoints with the `requireApiKey`
middleware (`backend/api/src/middleware/apiKey.js`).

> **Escrow payee:** the release step deliberately sends only `bookingId`. `TruxifyEscrow.releasePayment(uint256 bookingId)`
> pays `booking.driver`, which is bound when the deposit is built — a payout address must
> never be accepted from a webhook caller.

Audit the above with:

```bash
node automation/n8n/tests/dispute-resolution.security.test.js
```
