-- =============================================================================
-- Migration: RPC ownership checks must resolve the caller to profiles.id
-- (Issue #6275)
-- =============================================================================
-- Problem:
--   Truxify authenticates through Firebase. backend/api/src/middleware/auth.js
--   resolves each JWT to a profiles row and sets req.user.id = userProfile.id
--   (a random gen_random_uuid()), while the Firebase UID lives in
--   profiles.firebase_uid. In Postgres, auth.uid() is the Firebase UID (the
--   auth.users row id).
--
--   withdraw_funds_tx, submit_rating_tx and accept_bid_tx verified ownership by
--   comparing auth.uid() against a caller-supplied (or stored) profiles.id.
--   Because the two identifiers never match for a real authenticated user, the
--   guard always raised and withdrawals/ratings/bid-acceptance were blocked.
--   update_order_tx (20260802000000:54) and complete_trip_tx
--   (20260803100000:31) were already migrated to the get_profile_id() pattern;
--   these three functions were not.
--
-- Fix:
--   Redefine all three functions to compare get_profile_id() (which maps the
--   Firebase JWT sub to profiles.id) instead of the raw auth.uid(). The backend
--   already passes profiles.id (req.user.id) as p_driver_id/p_customer_id, so
--   no API change is required. The service_role bypass on accept_bid_tx (used
--   by escrow-funding reconciliation and confirm-deposit) is preserved.
--   accept_bid_tx also keeps the Issue #5777 anti-tamper guard: the order must
--   carry a pending_bid_acceptance snapshot whose bid_amount still matches the
--   stored bid before the bid is finalized.
